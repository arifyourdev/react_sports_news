                                                <p>
                                                    Until last weekend, Arsenal held a healthy eight-point
                                                    advantage over Manchester City. However, following
                                                    back-to-back draws, that has now trimmed to four, with the
                                                    holders also having a game in hand. What's even more damning
                                                    is that the Gunners threw away a two-goal lead in
                                                    consecutive games - Arsenal raced to a 2-0 lead quite early
                                                    against both Liverpool and West Ham - only to end both games
                                                    2-2.
